## Partnership

We assemble a team that pairs our expertise with your knowledge. We agree upon a designated “product owner.” This person acts as the voice of your organization during day-to-day development activities. You help us understand the stakeholder ecosystem and we set you up with the tools and know-how for continued success after our work is done.
## Discovery

Before building anything new, we learn about the current state of your service or system. Our team engages with your staff and users to develop a shared understanding of the problem we need to solve.

## Iteration

The product owner manages prioritization, while our technical and design leads oversee the development of prototypes. Throughout the process, we test our work with users to gather feedback and adjust course as needed.

## Reflection

Our team meets at the end of each iteration to acknowledge successes, identify issues, and discuss ways to improve. We maintain a continuous improvement mindset throughout the engagement.
