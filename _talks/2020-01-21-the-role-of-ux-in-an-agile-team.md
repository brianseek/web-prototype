Rachel Kroft, Senior UX Researcher at CivicActions, participated in a panel discussion with government practitioners on bringing good user experience to the public sector. The panel was hosted by AGL Association, which builds community and resources for modernizing government digital services.

The discussion included the most pressing issues facing the public sector UX community, such as:

* How does UX fit into an agile process?
* How can government recognize and hire good UX talent?
* How can firms compete successfully for agile dev and design contracts?
* How can we remove the walls between users and development teams?

Panelists also included Mike Palmer (U.S. Digital Service), Dana Chisnell (Center for Civic Design), Michael Akindele (UX and Product Innovation Specialist), Christy Hermansen (GSA), and Jagannath Chakravarty (Appian Corporation).
