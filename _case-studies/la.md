## Background

Too much red tape for aspiring entrepreneurs

Launching a new small business in Los Angeles can be intimidating. There are numerous — sometimes complex — requirements for registering, but also many helpful resources available. The City of Los Angeles wanted to support small business growth by streamlining assistance, resources, and guidance in a one-stop portal.

Los Angeles collaborated with the City of San Francisco to model the portal on their successful open source business platform. Los Angeles’ version would be tailored to meet the unique needs of the local business community, and the city sought new features, such as a “Startup in a Day” wizard. CivicActions collaborated with the design firm Tomorrow Partners to develop the site’s Drupal 7 distribution with new features and a component-driven content management system.
