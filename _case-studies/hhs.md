## Background

Public health data needs improvement

The open data portal for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) serves thousands of active users each week. It is used to meet federal open data requirements and also to help developers, policy makers, and health practitioners improve public health outcomes. The site is powered by DKAN, an open source open data platform used by many governments around the world to publish data.

Healthdata.gov was struggling to reach its full potential. It was overdue for software updates and cluttered with old datasets that contained broken links or missing resources. HHS needed help determining what data was important and developing strategies for keeping data up-to-date and easily accessible. CivicActions, as the maintaining organization for DKAN, stepped in to provide support and partnership to the dedicated HHS open data team.
